# Class7-PowerBI-Week24

Friends, you can choose one of the following options as the assignment of the Power BI course:

 1- Using the databases we used in the lesson, you can make a 2-page dashboard highlighting the data as follows.  I request you to create "features" that are not directly included in the tables by creating new "calculated columns" and "measures".
 * Total number of loan payments
 * Loan expiry date
 * Number of remaining loan payments.
 * Unpaid loan amount
 * Total loan amount
 * Total commission amount
 * Ratio of commissions to total credit
 * Total amount of loan paid
 * Average loan amount
 * Average loan period (months)
 * You can visualize this data by years, loan types, branches and cities.

 2- You can create a 2-page dashboard using data modeling, "calculated columns" and "measures" features using a database you used in previous lessons.
